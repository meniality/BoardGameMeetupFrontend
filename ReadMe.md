This is a board game scheduling/ info app that was built over 5 days as a project for FlatIron Schools. 

Within this project I built a custom back end that runs on Ruby on rails and pulled in 100 board games from an outside API. 
I used vanilla javascript, html, and css to style the pages. 

Withing the app you can create a new meetup which includes date, time, location and you can pick from the game from what is currently loaded in the back end. Upopn submiting this form is adds a new meet up card on the front page. You can also add new users on the front page. You can click on any meetup card and it brings you to its individual show page. On this page it displays the info for the meetup along with which players are currently signed up for the meetup. On this page you can add players, update the location and delete the meetup. You can click on either the game name or player name and it will bring you to their indivdual show pages with addional information.
